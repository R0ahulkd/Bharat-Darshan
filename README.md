🌄 BharatDarshan – Web Technologies College Project

A front-end website created for academic learning as part of a Web Technologies subject.

📚 Project Context

BharatDarshan is an individual college project developed as a part of the Web Technologies subject under my MCA program at Lovely Professional University (LPU).

The goal of this project was to apply and demonstrate frontend web development concepts using HTML5, CSS3, responsive design techniques, and Bootstrap components — specifically in the context of building a tourism-themed educational site.

🚨 This is not a commercial or real-world product. It is a college-level individual work developed for learning and assessment purposes only.

🧭 Project Overview

BharatDarshan is a static, multi-section website that presents spiritual travel destinations in India. The site includes:

A fixed navigation bar
Hero section with call-to-action
Card-based listing of destinations
A responsive layout
Footer with contact and link info
The primary objective was to practice frontend layout, styling, and mobile responsiveness using foundational technologies.

🧰 Technologies Used

✅ HTML5 – Semantic page structure
✅ CSS3 – Styling and layout customization
✅ Bootstrap 5 – Responsive grid system and utility classes
✅ Media Queries – For adaptive layout adjustments
✅ Font & Image Assets – Included via CDN and local sources
